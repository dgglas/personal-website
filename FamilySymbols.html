          <p class="subheading">History</p>
          <p class="description">
            The Lord Lyon first granted a patent for a coat of arms for the city
            of Glasgow in 1866. Before this time, there were at least three
            official coats of arms in use. The first seal to use all the
            elements associated with the coat of arms was that of the Chapter of
            Glasgow, in use from 1488-1540, but they did not appear in something
            close to their present combination until 1647. Since it was first
            granted, various versions of the symbol have been in use. The
            current version of the coat of arms dates from April 1996, when it
            was granted following a local authority reshuffle.

      <p class="subheading">Symbolism</p>
      <p class="description">
        The symbols appearing on the coat of arms represents the life and
        legends of Saint Mungo, the patron saint of Glasgow, and are often
        remembered by the following poem:
      </p>
      <p class="description poem">
        <em
          >Here is the tree that never grew<br />
          Here is the bird that never flew<br />
          Here is the fish that never swam<br />
          Here is the bell that never rang<br />
          Here is the ring that never wed<br />
          Here is the book that&rsquo;s never read</em
        >
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        The tree referred to in this poem is depicted as an Oak tree in the coat
        of arms, but popular versions of the story refer to a holly branch. The
        story goes that he was once left in charge of watching a holy fire by
        Saint Serf, but the fire was put out by some other boys jealous of St.
        Mungo after he fell asleep. Upon awakening, St. Mungo was able to
        miraculously light a new fire from the tree branch. The bird referred to
        in the poem is a robin which was tamed by St. Mungo's teacher, St.Serf
        which was revived by St. Mungo after it was killed by some of his
        classmates. Three fish are depicted in the coat of arms, each with a
        ring in its mouth. This references the story St. Mungo being able to
        retrieve a lost golden ring belonging to Queen Languoreth of Strathclyde
        from the mouth of a fish fished from the River Clyde. The bell is an
        item which may have been given to St. Mungo by the Pope, but this is not
        known for sure. In any case St. Mungo's bell was a notable institution
        in Glasgow. The bell no longer exists, with a replacement having been
        purchased in 1641. St. Mungo himself also appears on the coat of arms as
        the crest above the imagery described above, with his hand raised as if
        to give a benediction.

        The motto depicted on the coat of arms is "Let Glasgow Flourish". This
        is a shortened version of the phrase "Lord, let Glasgow flourish by the
        preaching of the word" which St. Mungo is said to have used within one
        of his sermons.

            The ancestors of the Glasgow family lived among the
            Strathclyde-Briton people of the Scottish/English Borderlands.
            Glasgow is a name for someone who lived in the city of Glasgow on
            the river Clyde in the county of Renfrew (first recorded in 1116 as
            Glasgu), or from either of two minor places with the same name in
            Aberdeenshire. The origins of the place name are uncertain, it may
            come from the Welsh glas, or "gray," and cau, meaning "hollows."

            The surname Glasgow was first found in Renfrewshire (Gaelic:
            Siorrachd Rinn Fri√π), a historic county of Scotland, today
            encompassing the Council Areas of Renfrew, East Renfrewshire, and
            Iverclyde, in the Strathclyde region of southwestern Scotland, where
            they held a family seat from very ancient times, some say well
            before the Norman Conquest and the arrival of Duke William at
            Hastings in 1066 A.D.

      <p class="subheading">Glasgow Spelling Variations</p>
      <p class="description">
        Spelling and translation were hardly exact sciences in Medieval
        Scotland. Sound, rather than any set of rules, was the basis for
        spellings, so one name was often spelled different ways even within a
        single document. Spelling variations are thus an extremely common
        occurrence in Medieval Scottish names. Glasgow has been spelled
        Glassgow, Glasgow, Glassgaw and others.

          The name Glasgow is a very old and distinguished one. It has been
          recorded even before the Norman Conquest and the arrival of William
          Duke of Hastings in 1066. The name has been spelled
          Glasgow,Glassgaw,Glassgow, Glascho,Glascu,and Glascou. The first
          records of the name were found in Renfrewshire,which is five miles
          west of Glasgow.<br /><br />Fun fact:
          <em><strong> Glaschu</strong></em>
          is gaelic for Glasgow.
