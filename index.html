          <p class="description">
            Ok, yes... I built a web site. Before anyone says anything "smart"
            let me explain. Since I've been retired for some time now (long,
            painful story so DON'T ASK!!) I've looked for "distractions." Since
            smoking, drinking, and gambling were non-starters, I decided I
            wanted to learn "stuff".
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            My first distraction was a program called Blender which is a free,
            open source 3D CGI creation suite. It supports the entirety of the
            3D and video creation methods.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            Next came crafting. But, not just any crafting, I had to geek it up.
            Someone had mentioned Dungeons and Dragons and I thought "Hey,
            wouldn't it be cool to make the playing arena?" I found a few
            YouTube videos and I was off! I built paths, walls, traps, bridges,
            buildings, etc. I even tried my hand a painting the small (very
            small) figures that are used. My take-awat was that I should not be
            allowed to paint small figures... ever!
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            After moving I had no need/desire to keep crafting. So, and I have
            no idea why, I started studying electronics. I read books, looked
            online, and watched videos. In a short time I was able to build a
            few circuits. Most of them dealt with making an LED flash. Well, I
            wanted MORE! So I started looking into programmable circuits. Now, I
            could blink multiple LEDs at different rates and times. OK, now
            we're getting somewhere.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            Then one day, while writing a small LED blinking program, I thought
            "Hey, I should probalby learn more about programming so I can do
            really neat stuff." So, you guessed it, my new distraction was
            learing computer programming languages. I've got two under my belt
            now. At some point, I noticed that a lot of my research and
            tutorials were web based... Hmmmmm.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            Years ago I learned how to write basic HTML to build webpages. Since
            then there is a whole new HTML with advanced features. So, my fifth
            diversion was to learn HTML, along with web design and layouts.
            Lucky me, there is a programming side to web design using something
            called JavaScript for which I have already downloaded the course.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            So, returning to the beginning of this story, I built a web site to
            hold different pages that I can practice designing, and styling. At
            least, that is, until the next shiny thing grabs my attention.

          <p class="description">
            One of the "fun" things about having a Scottish heratige is that our
            name carries with it severel different symbols. The Glasgow's have a
            Family Crest and a Tartan. Additionally, the city of Glasgow has a
            Coat of Arms.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            The city of Glasgow also, apparently likes it's skyline. Looking
            through many images an abundant amount of them were of skylines.

          <p class="description">

            like or their different meanings then please
